                system of seven known planets. Its mass is about 9% of the Sun's with a radius slightly larger than the

                planets in orbit around TRAPPIST-1, a data "anomaly" was found to be caused by five more planets. Their
                orbital periods – the time each planet takes to orbit the star – range roughly from 1.5 to 19 Earth
                days. The gravity of TRAPPIST-1's planets holds them in orbital resonance, which could have existed

                TRAPPIST-1e is confirmed to not have a cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, meaning it is more
                likely to have a compact, hydrogen-free atmosphere like those of our Solar System's rocky planets,
                further raising the chances of habitability. Hydrogen is a powerful greenhouse gas, so if there was
                enough to be easily detected, it would mean that the surface of TRAPPIST-1e would be inhospitable.
                Since such an atmosphere is not present, it raises the chances for the planet to have a more Earth-like
                atmosphere instead. However, no atmosphere has been detected, and it is still possible that the planet
                has no atmosphere at all. Additionally, no helium emission from TRAPPIST-1e was detected as of 2021.

                The exoplanet was announced to be orbiting within the habitable zone of its parent star, the region
                where, with the correct conditions and atmospheric properties, liquid water may exist on the surface of
                the planet. TRAPPIST-1e has a radius of around 0.91 REarth, so it is likely a rocky planet. Its host
                star is a red ultracool dwarf, with only about 8% of the mass of the Sun (close to the boundary between
                brown dwarfs and hydrogen-fusing stars). As a result, stars like TRAPPIST-1 have the potential to remain
                stable for up to 12 trillion years, which is over 1,000 times longer than the Sun.
            </p>
            <p class="p-solar">
                The planet receives a stellar flux 60.4% that of Earth, about a third lower than that of Earth but
                significantly more than that of Mars. Its equilibrium temperature ranges from 225 K (-48 °C; -55
                °F) to 246.1 K (-27.1 °C; -16.7 °F), depending on how much light the planet reflects into space.
                Both of these are between those of Earth and Mars as well. In addition, its atmosphere is confirmed to
                not be dense or thick enough to harm the habitability potential as well, according to models by the
                University of Washington. The atmosphere, if it is strong enough, may also help to transfer
                additional heat to the dark side of the planet.
